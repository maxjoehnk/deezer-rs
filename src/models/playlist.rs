/// # Examples
///
/// You can query a playlist by id via the [`DeezerObject::get()`] method:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use deezer::models::*;
/// # use deezer::DeezerError;
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), DeezerError> {
/// let playlist = Playlist::get(908622995).await?.unwrap();
/// # assert_eq!(playlist.id, 908622995);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Or you can use [`DeezerClient::playlist()`](crate::DeezerClient::playlist()):
///
/// ```rust
/// # use deezer::models::*;
/// # use deezer::{DeezerClient, DeezerError};
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), DeezerError> {
/// let deezer = DeezerClient::new();
/// let album = deezer.playlist(908622995).await?.unwrap();
/// # assert_eq!(album.id, 908622995);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }

/// You can query a track by id via the [`DeezerObject::get()`] method:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use deezer::models::*;
/// # use deezer::DeezerError;
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), DeezerError> {
/// let track = Track::get(912486).await?.unwrap();
/// # assert_eq!(track.id, 912486);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Or you can use [`DeezerClient::track()`](crate::DeezerClient::track()):
///
/// ```rust
/// # use deezer::models::*;
/// # use deezer::{DeezerClient, DeezerError};
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), DeezerError> {
/// let deezer = DeezerClient::new();
/// let track = deezer.track(912486).await?.unwrap();
/// # assert_eq!(track.id, 912486);
/// # Ok(())

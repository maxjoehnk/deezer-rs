///
/// # Examples
///
/// You can query an album by id via the [`DeezerObject::get()`] method:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use deezer::models::*;
/// # use deezer::DeezerError;
/// #
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), DeezerError> {
/// let album = Album::get(302127).await?.unwrap();
/// # assert_eq!(album.id, 302127);
/// # println!("{:?}", album);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// Or you can use [`DeezerClient::album()`](crate::DeezerClient::album()):
///
/// ```rust
/// # use deezer::models::*;
/// # use deezer::{DeezerClient, DeezerError};
/// #
/// # #[tokio::main]
/// # async fn main() -> Result<(), DeezerError> {
/// let deezer = DeezerClient::new();
///
/// let album = deezer.album(302127).await?.unwrap();
/// # assert_eq!(album.id, 302127);
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
